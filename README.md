MealBux Subsidy eDoc
====================

Mealbux Subsidy Request form for Oregon State University using Kuali's eDoc form. This example is 
meant to be a first iteration on creating this form while testing eDocLite with a real world example.
For the first iteration, we're only going to have two possible nodes in the KEW routing the student
sends it to the approver and the approver sends it back for modification if needed. For more information
